words right out of my mouth.\n[Speaker 5207298135856666814]: Absolutely.\n[Speaker 5207298135856666814]: We'd love to tailor it to make it most relevant even if you had like premade figures that are not like sensitive that you wanted us to recreate.\n[Speaker 5207298135856666814]: We'd be more than happy to do that.\n[Speaker 5207298135856666814]: In the past with other teams at GSK doing these demonstrations and bringing leadership in has been pretty impactful.\n[Speaker 5207298135856666814]: And as I said, there are a few groups like bio as a team, some screen profiling teams that are already on the group licensing.\n[Speaker 5207298135856666814]: So we have kind of a, we have a place to start from for sure.\n[Speaker 2127558124599988723]: So, do you know which group within GSK is

of groups on group licenses.\n[Speaker 5207298135856666814]: Ultimately, it would be great to have like all GSK that's the ultimate goal so that we can have like cross departmental

in?\n[Speaker 8624878554023739290]: So the other say 30 people might be locked out entirely?\n[Speaker 5207298135856666814]: Yeah.\n[Speaker 5207298135856666814...", "callTitle": "BioRender <> GSK:
