stage gate meetings at a faster pace without all of that extra work.\n[Speaker 7948912558621981906]: So, I think it actually falls quite in line well in line with what you were saying about, you know, bringing in vendors to add efficiencies and make sure that things are easier and smoother and simpler.\n[Speaker 7948912558621981906]: One of the interesting things we're doing these days is we've, actually started partnering with departments that are looking to pilot biorender across their department.\n[Speaker 7948912558621981906]: And so those are really interesting because they're like low
