to go through is that it's quite intensive for astrazeneca because right now, there's probably about 60 or 70 people that have random one, enough licenses at astrazeneca.\n[Speaker 3172282231777553146]: And the reason why that's not great for astrazeneca and a runner is that there's like 60 or 70 different purchase orders.\n[Speaker 3172282231777553146]: There's 60 or 70 different start and end dates.\n[Speaker 3172282231777553146]: And the reality of the licenses, when you purchase it selfserve Miriam is that if you buy a selfserve license right now, if you leave astrazeneca within the next year, you take that with you.\n[Speaker 3172282231777553146]: There's no way for astrazeneca to take that license and reassign it to another individual.\n[Speaker 3172282231777553146]: Whereas a group can do something like that.\n[Speaker 3172282231777553146]: And so, ", "contextAfter": "\n[Speaker 8965606864874366262]: Yeah.\n[Speaker 3172282231777553146]: I was working with somebody in sweden and she was able to set up a group license and they didn't buy enough licenses yet.\n[Speaker 3172282231777553146]: But they still bought about 83 licenses.\n[Speaker 3172282231777553146]: And one is they were able to buy, a block license to provide it to people in, the us, the UK.\n[Speaker 3172282231777553146]: And sweden.\n[Speaker 3172282231777553146]: Now, when you buy a license, the benefit to that is that the licenses you can easily distribute them, you can easily transfer them and the price is a lot cheaper as well.\n[Speaker 8965606864874366262]: So.\n[Speaker 3172282231777553146]: I'm like I'm more than happy to set you up, with a singular license, but I spoke to some people in it recently in astrazeneca

to go through is that it's quite intensive for astrazeneca because right now, there's probably about 60 or 70 people that have random one, enough licenses at astrazeneca.\n[Speaker 3172282231777553146]: And the reason why that's not great for astrazeneca and a runner is that there's like 60 or 70 different purchase orders.\n[Speaker 3172282231777553146]: There's 60 or 70 different start and end dates.\n[Speaker 3172282231777553146]: And the reality of the licenses, when you purchase it selfserve Miriam is that if you buy a selfserve license right now, if you leave astrazeneca within the next year, you take that with you.\n[Speaker 3172282231777553146]: There's no way for astrazeneca to take that license and reassign it to another individual.\n[Speaker 3172282231777553146]: Whereas a group can do something like that.\n[Speaker 3172282231777553146]: And so, ", "contextAfter": "\n[Speaker 8965606864874366262]: Yeah.\n[Speaker 3172282231777553146]: I was working with somebody in sweden and she was able to set up a group license and they didn't buy enough licenses yet.\n[Speaker 3172282231777553146]: But they still bought about 83 licenses.\n[Speaker 3172282231777553146]: And one is they were able to buy, a block license to provide it to people in, the us, the UK.\n[Speaker 3172282231777553146]: And sweden.\n[Speaker 3172282231777553146]: Now, when you buy a license, the benefit to that is that the licenses you can easily distribute them, you can easily transfer them and the price is a lot cheaper as well.\n[Speaker 8965606864874366262]: So.\n[Speaker 3172282231777553146]: I'm like I'm more than happy to set you up, with a singular license, but I spoke to some people in it recently in astrazeneca and, they want to try to move away from that and set up group licenses because it's a, and then the minimum for a group licenses is just five licenses.\n[Speaker 31722822317775...", "callTitle":
