really what I wanted to do during this call was to just quickly align on the launch and sso process because we did receive all of the POS already.\n[Speaker 8753199157744361751]: We can go ahead and actually start letting people onto the license.\n[Speaker 8753199157744361751]: But I know that with the sso, I just wanted to make sure that we were all on the same page on how we want to get the word out to everyone.\n[Speaker 8753199157744361751]: And so with that being said, what we can do first is if we wanted to invite, we can invite people who are shared on the two lists from Basel and the us and invite them onto the license first and so that they can have access.\n[Speaker 8753199157744361751]: ", "contextAfter": "\n[Speaker 8753199157744361751]: So only the people that are invited

license either by, on our side or invited by you.\n[Speaker 8753199157744361751]: Does that work for the team?\n[Speaker 2209671332130699400]: Sounds like a good plan.\n[Speaker 8753199157744361751]: Okay.\n[Speaker 8753199157744361751]: Sounds good.\n[Speaker 8753199157744361751]: Okay\u2026 perfect.\n[Speaker 8753199157744361751]: And then, so what we can do is get them onto the license.\n[Speaker 8753199157744361751]: They can start using it and like, you know, take advantage of the license ahead of sso being launched without any issues of, you know, the link circulating.\n[Speaker 8753199157744361751]: The second thing is to get the sso process going.\n[Speaker 8753199157744361751]: Someone on the novartis side needs to submit a ticket...", "callTitle":

those publications.\n[Speaker 6436655207588388007]: So that Novartis has ownership over all the images.\n[Speaker 6436655207588388007]: So that's really good to know in terms of these internal
