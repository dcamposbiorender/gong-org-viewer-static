within oncology, we have the different types of oncology, So that's like ADCs which is tumor targeting, and you have like immune oncology, and you have tumor intrinsic.\n[Speaker 5108777002233740723]: So, and I think the other orgs all have like breakdowns depending on what the different, Major mechanisms of targeting the disease are.\n[Speaker 5108777002233740723]: And then each of the, those groups tends to have like representation at different sites.\n[Speaker 5108777002233740723]: And, even once you've split it kind of into those little, into those chunks, you've still got relatively
